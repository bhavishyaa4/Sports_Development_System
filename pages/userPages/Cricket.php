                <h1>Cricket</h1>
                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>Cricket is a game in which there are two teams which includes 11 players on the either sides.
                    Before the match starts the captain of each team will do a toss and whichever team wins the
                    toss have to decide whether they will ‘Bat’ or ‘Ball’. If they choose bat so they have to score
                    an amount of runs which the other team could achieve and if they choose ball so they have to stop
                    the other team to score many runs. Runs can be achieved by running between the wickets or by hitting
                    boundaries and a boundary scores the batsmen 4 runs or 6 runs.</p>
                <p>Cricket originally belongs to England because cricket was first played in the south-east
                    England. The cricket match could consist of different overs for example 20 overs, 50 overs
                    and so on. Cricket is a game which could be divided into two parts overs and innings. Overs
                    consists of 6 ball and an inning consists of multiple overs.</p>
