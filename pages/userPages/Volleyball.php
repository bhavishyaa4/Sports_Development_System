                <h1>Volleyball</h1>
                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>Volleyball is a high-energy team sport played by two teams of six players separated by a net.
                    There are teams on either side of the net. One team hits the ball over the net line and into
                    the other team’s court or area, the other team must then hit the ball back over the net and in
                    bounds within three tries without letting the ball contact the floor. They are indoor and beach
                    volleyball and both are sports that are a part of the Olympics games and have competitive leagues.
                </p>
                <p>William Morgan invented the game of Volleyball in 1885. He was an athletic director at the YMCA
                    and was trying to emulate basketball and came up with volleyball. Since then, the rules have
                    changed here and there, but it quickly became a popular sport at the YMCA. </p>
