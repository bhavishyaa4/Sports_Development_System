                <h1>Basketball</h1>
                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players, each opposing one
                    another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball . The
                    team with most points at the end of the game wins, but if regualtion play expires with the score tied,
                    an additional period of play(overtime) is mandated.</p>
                <p>Invented in 1891, by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the
                    United States, basketball has evolved to become on of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.
                    The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in
                    terms of popularity, salaries, talent and level of competition (drawing most of its talent from U.S college
                    basketball).</p>
